    <h1>X-Class Racing</h1>  <p><strong>Project Manager/Author: David Hooper</strong> | Diego Uribe | Amira Ryce | Ann Cherayil | Arno Zhang | Rafi Hanafiah | Trisha Bhattacharyya | Jason Anderson | Justin Wang | Michelle Gantos | Elizabeth Avelar</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The X Class project team started because of an interest in the local Bay-area meetup group that would race large scale racing drones at Cesar Chavez Park. The meetup group wanted to see more involvement from UC Berkeley and asked me if I could create a team of Cal students that would build and race an X Class racing drone! The challenge was accepted!</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>The motivation behind this project was to teach students how to scale mini quadcopter drone racing to larger scale X Class drone racing. Students would learn how to calculate appropriate motor stator sizes and KV, propeller length and pitch, ESC minimum current handling, battery capacity and voltage, and on-board electronics for flight controller, video system, and receiver, as well as optimal frame construction. Upon successful completion of creating an X Class racing drone, students would compete in a drone race among other teams from across the USA to showcase what they’ve learned and to also put to the test their engineering work of building a large scale racing drone.</p>

<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="/../../images/projects/xclass/xclass1.png" alt="" /></span>The goal of the X Class project team was to build a 1000mm racing drone to compete in the X Class Drone Racing competition series. We grouped our students into subteams so that each subteam would be responsible for a set of parts that make up the drone. We successfully built our first version of our drone and competed in the final race of the 2017 X Class Drone Racing competition series. From what we learned at the race, we decided to build a second version of our drone to include a redesigned aerodynamic canopy as well as a better and faster power system.</p>

<h3 id="subteams">Subteams</h3>

<h4 id="power-system-team">Power System Team</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This subteam worked on testing different combinations of motors, ESCs, propellers, and batteries, in order to characterize the optimal setup for our racing drone. This includes capturing data on the motor-thrust stand for different power system combinations.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="electrical-team">Electrical Team</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This subteam learned how to incorporate different flight electronics into the drone’s power system in order to have a full electrification of the racing drone. This includes setting up the drone’s onboard flight controller with the open source flight control firmware, Betaflight, as well as utilizing the receiver’s SBUS digital control signal, captured from the pilot’s transmitter, to operate the drone.</li>
  <li>The team also learned how to solder different FPV components together to build a video system capable of transmitting the drone camera’s live video feed through a 5.8GHz frequency analog video signal by using a video transmitter.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="frame-design-team">Frame Design Team</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This subteam designed and prototyped our drone’s frame as well as all of the hardware parts that make up the drone’s power system and electrical system. The team used Autodesk Fusion 360 to model all of the various parts on the drone. For creating 3D printed parts, the team learned how to use the Creality CR-10 3D printer as well as the 3D printing slicing software, Simplify3D.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<h4 id="electronics">Electronics</h4>

<p>Because of the size of our drone, most components needed adjusting. Bigger propellers required motors that would end up drawing larger amounts of current. This meant that we required electrical components that could handle a higher current draw (e.g. thicker wire and ESCs with a higher current rating). We also ran into an issue with one of our ESC’s malfunctioning the night before our first race, requiring a last minute replacement.</p>

<h4 id="frame">Frame</h4>

<p>3D printed parts were our first choice for testing different part designs on our drone. We found early on (during our first race) that 3D printed parts served a good use (rapid prototyping), but should be modified (increased infill) so that they have a better chance of withstanding a crash.</p>

<h4 id="tuning">Tuning</h4>

<p>Tuning a drone is no easy feat, we found this to be true when we started to tune the PIDs on our drone. Due to the drone’s larger size, the regular technique of tuning smaller mini quadcopters proved to be fruitless. The larger drone had a tendency to oscillate when there was a larger D gain. By lowering the D gain, we were able to adequately tune the drone for our first race.</p>

<h4 id="racing">Racing</h4>

<p>Flying a larger drone in a race presents a much larger care to fly carefully. Since there is more flying mass, crashes tend to turn out more extreme. Learning to fly conservatively while still maintaining a decent lead during the race required a newfound balance to fly the larger drone.</p>

<h2 id="design-approach">Design Approach</h2>

<p>Each subteam modeled one or more of the drone components on Fusion 360, where we then were able to assemble a virtual drone before physically building it. This gave us a better idea of how we would 3D print the mounts, and it also helped us ensure that everything could fit together comfortably.
After modeling the first drone, we began building. We used solid wooden dowels for the arms and a 4-way tee PVC connector at the center. Our 3D-printed mounts for the ESCs were positioned on the dowels to be halfway between the motors and the PDB, and they were secured to the frame with zip ties.
For the second drone, we decided to use different motors and ESCs, and we followed the same approach of modeling before building. However, based off of some complications experienced with the first drone, some adjustments were made. We decided to use hollow rectangular aluminum pipes for the arms of the drone to make the frame more solid but maintain a lightweight, and our mounts will be printed with more infill.</p>

<h2 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h2>

<p>Our team extensively used techniques such as 3D printing and 3D modeling to rapidly prototype our designs. The majority of the team learned how to use Fusion 360 in order to create design sketches which we then used to create 3D objects through functions such as extruding, revolving, circular patterns, etc. We then took our 3D models and exported them to “.stl” files for the 3D printer to print. We used a combinations of PLA and TPU plastic materials when 3D printing our various parts. We also used PVC, wood, and aluminum parts to build our drone frame.</p>
