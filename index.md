We are a student organization dedicated towards providing a central resource hub for all things related to unmanned aerial vehicles within UC Berkeley, which include multirotors, fixed wing aircraft, and other miscellaneous UAVs.

## About

By providing a resource-rich organization for UC Berkeley students interested in designing, building, and/or flying UAVs for a multitude of purposes, we hope to encourage collaboration across multiple engineering disciplines. Students will be encouraged to step out of their comfort zone and learn new skills by working on project teams with other majors. Activities include a range of aerial photography/videography projects, academic research projects, and racing competitions.

## About

By providing a resource-rich organization for UC Berkeley students interested in designing, building, and/or flying UAVs for a multitude of purposes, we hope to encourage collaboration across multiple engineering disciplines. Students will be encouraged to step out of their comfort zone and learn new skills by working on project teams with other majors.   Activities include a range of aerial photography/videography projects, academic research projects, and racing competitions. Other goals include: teaching basic, intermediate, and advanced courses in flying, operating, and controlling UAVs; organizing and setting up events for UAV flying meet-ups and outreach opportunities; and creating an open space for all UAV enthusiasts, engineers, and flyers to collaborate and create new and rich experiences through the use of UAVs.  Above all, UAVs @ Berkeley seeks to bring the capabilities and potential of unmanned aerial vehicles to the minds and hands of students, engineers, and the public alike.

## History

Founded in the Fall 2015 semester, UAVs@Berkeley came to life out of a need for a place so that students at UC Berkeley who were interested in UAVs could come together and make exciting and bountiful possibilities happen in regards to UAVs.

Off to a quick start, UAVs@Berkeley began a search in September 2015 for a Leadership Team who could effectively manage the student organization and give a good direction as to where the group was headed. Out of the search came a group of individuals that encompassed a range of technical abilities, logistical talents, and cunning skill to properly manage the new student organization. Though the Leadership Team encompassed many skills, they were not all complete experts in the field of UAVs. This would not be cause for alarm for the team, since they viewed the possibility of what they were doing as so great, that they knew that through their journey into the world of UAVs and bringing that closer to the UC Berkeley community, they would make history happen.

Fast forward to two years, and the group has grown to over 500 members and growing stronger and larger, day by day. The interest in drones in the UC Berkeley community is large, but the presence is somewhat lacking. That is why UAVs@Berkeley is here – to change the story and make history happen by allowing students to find out about the exciting possibilities that drones have to offer.

Come join us, and you’ll see why the movement is contagious – it’s something more than just about a drone – it’s about building, flying, and collaborating.
