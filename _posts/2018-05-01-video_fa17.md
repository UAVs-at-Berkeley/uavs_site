## Introduction

Hey there, this is Joel! I was pseudo-in-charge of the Video/Photo team in the transitory period of Sp17 and Fa17 in which we had no official leader. For Spring ‘17, the video/photo team had disappeared for the most part. However, I still created a video from some clips we had from the first semester. Below is the year end video for the 2016-2017 school year.

## Transitioning

During the Fa17 semester, our current leader, Nick, took the lead for the team just before the final milestone. I feel he’s a good person to lead the team as he’s very passionate about videography/photography and I look forward to the videos he and his team will produce.

Anyways, as the semester finishes, there’s always a video that is made. The video is below:
