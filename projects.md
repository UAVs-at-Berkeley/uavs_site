Our teams work hard on their projects. Innovating in the space of aerial robotics is our passion, but documenting and communicating our work is just as important as the tech itself. Listed below are the blog posts that project managers write after each semester to reflect on their project. The blog posts discuss the successes and the failures of each team, and serve as an archive for passing knowledge down to later generations of club members.
